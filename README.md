Posero
======

Presentation (replay!) of text or terminal action in Vim. Copy any kind of text
from the terminal into a file and use ``Posero`` or use *any* kind of plain
text file to use it as presentation material.

Why oh why?
-----------
I researched a bunch of terminal recording applications including ``ttyrec``
but all of them lacked the ability to all of these features I wanted:

* Be able to start/stop/rewind/forward/clear a session.
* Post editing (a few apps saved their output to a binary). Nothing better than
  plain text files.
* Add notes to actual output, like comments.
* Arbitrary, powerful syntax highlighting *adpated to your color scheme*.
* Custom specific options per slide.
* Add custom syntax to non-syntax output (for example: curl output)
